git-overview
==========

A summary of git.

## Commits
* Used to add one portion of code (for example, one enhancement or one bug fix)
* Each enhancement or big fix should be in its own commit (don't work on two things at once)
* Use descriptive, but concise commit messages
* Denote when an issue is fixed by referencing its number (for example, "Fixed stuttering bug (fixes #2)")
* Push commits regularly

## Tips
* Avoid editing more files than needed
* Commits don't need to be pushed once created, but the sooner the better
* Follow @NavalBattle for real-time commit logs
